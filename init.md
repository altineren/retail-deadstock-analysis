# SE390 Midterm Project Init

## Challenge Overview
- **Problem Focus:** Predict and mitigate dead stock risk in Turkey's e-commerce sector.
- **Goal:** Design an AI-powered concept that scores product-level dead stock risk, surfaces actionable insights, and shows measurable operations, finance, and CX benefits.
- **Collaboration:** Teams of up to 3; define a creative team name used on every deliverable.

## Required Deliverables
### 1. Written Report (3-5 pages, PDF)
1. Cover page with team name, members + IDs, project title, date.
2. Executive summary (≈0.5 page) covering problem, solution (2-3 sentences), impact.
3. Problem analysis (≈1 page) explaining dead stock definition, criticality, current challenges, scale/impact.
4. Proposed AI solution (1-2 pages):
   - Operating principle, AI/ML techniques (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest, anomaly detection).
   - Required data features & sources.
   - System architecture diagram + explanation.
   - **Technical feasibility:** technology stack (Python libs, frameworks, DBs), high-level implementation, data pipeline, scalability, integration touchpoints, expected metrics.
5. Business impact & implementation (≈1 page): operational gains, cost-benefit, CX benefits, implementation challenges/mitigations, ROI projection.
6. Conclusion & future work (≈0.5 page): key takeaways, next steps, expansion ideas.
7. Include visuals/diagrams, cite references, proofread; do not copy-paste AI output.

### 2. Presentation Deck (1-10 slides; Canva preferred)
- Opening slide: team name/logo, project title, members.
- Problem definition (1-2 slides): what/why/scale of dead stock.
- AI solution proposal (3-4 slides): prediction approach, data, ML technique, architecture diagram, tech stack, business value.
- Demo showcase (1-2 slides): mockup/prototype screenshots, UI design, key features, demo link if available.
- Business impact (1-2 slides): operational + CX benefits, feasibility, ROI.
- Conclusion (1 slide): takeaways, expected impact, next steps.
- Maintain professional design, consistent theme, readable fonts, clear visuals.

### 3. Demo / Prototype (required)
- Minimum: mockup/wireframe/static dashboard/simple webpage or Python script exemplifying prediction logic.
- Provide screenshots in presentation and description in report; link or files if digital.

## Bonus Opportunity (+10)
- Build a fully functional, polished demo (e.g., Streamlit, Flask, Gradio) with working AI/ML predictions, professional UI, live presentation. Only pursue after core deliverables are solid.

## Evaluation Criteria (100 pts + bonus)
- Problem understanding (15). Clarity, impact, research.
- Solution design & technical feasibility (20). AI approach, innovation, stack, architecture, data, scalability.
- Demo/prototype quality (10). Completeness, UI, concept clarity.
- Business viability (10). Value proposition, feasibility, quantified impact, ROI.
- Written report quality (20). Completeness, clarity, professionalism, visuals.
- Presentation quality (25). Design, structure, delivery, teamwork.
- Bonus fully functional working demo (+10). Real, polished, deployed, live demo.

## Timeline & Tips
- Complete during class session; prioritize: report → demo mockup → presentation → rehearsal.
- Choose team name quickly (<5 min). Use templates to speed formatting.
- For bonus: allocate ~30-45 min feasibility analysis + 45-60 min coding if capable.
- Avoid vague technical details, missing architecture diagrams, generic mockups, weak business impact, poor organization, overtime presentations, or missing team name.

## Next Steps Checklist
1. Confirm team size, name, and roles (research, AI design, presentation/demo).
2. Outline report sections with responsibilities and deadlines.
3. Draft system architecture + data pipeline concept.
4. Decide demo format (mockup vs. functional) and required tools.
5. Gather supporting research/metrics for problem impact and expected ROI.
